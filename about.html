    <h2>Our History </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">For over 75 years, our family has been proud to serve the hardworking people of Memphis. What started as a small, word-of-mouth operation by J.G. Ace’s grandfather has grown into a trusted local service that connects people with the help they need—no matter how big or small the task. From hauling dumpsters to the curb and back, to washing them out, or even scooping dog poop every week, we’ve built our reputation on showing up, getting it done right, and treating every customer like a neighbor.

      Led today by J.G. Ace, who carries the same grit and dedication as the generations before him, our business is rooted in a strong belief: that everyone deserves reliable, honest help without the hassle. <br> J.G. grew up working alongside his father and grandfather, learning firsthand that building a business worth trusting takes time, sweat, and a whole lot of heart. That legacy lives on in everything we do—especially in the pride we take in every service we offer.
      
      Over the years, we’ve adapted with the times while never losing sight of our mission: making life a little easier for the people of Memphis. <br> Whether you're looking for someone to take care of the dirty work or need dependable help for recurring tasks, we’re here to bridge the gap between people who need services and those ready to roll up their sleeves.
      
      At the end of the day, we’re more than just a business—we’re a part of the community. Built on decades of trust, fueled by family values, and grounded in a deep love for Memphis, we’re honored to be the name our neighbors call when they need a hand.</p>
